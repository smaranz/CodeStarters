    "What is Fire Hacks?",
    "Fire Hacks is a one-day in-person hackathon for high school students in the Bay Area. It's organized by CodeStarters and focused entirely on software — web, mobile, and AI/ML. You'll build a project from scratch, attend workshops, eat great food, and compete for $30K+ in prizes.",
  ],
  [
    "Who can attend?",
    "Any current high school student (grades 9–12) can apply. No prior hackathon or coding experience is required — we'll have beginner-friendly workshops and mentors to help you get started.",
  ],
  [
    "How much does it cost?",
    "Nothing. Fire Hacks is 100% free to attend. Meals, snacks, swag, and everything else are fully covered by our sponsors.",
  ],
  [
    "What should I build?",
    "Anything software-based. You can choose from tracks like Web Development, AI/ML, Mobile App Dev, Cybersecurity, or Game Dev. Build something that solves a real problem, explores a new technology, or is just plain fun.",
  ],
  [
    "How do I become a sponsor?",
    "We'd love to hear from you! Email us at codestarters26@gmail.com, or view our sponsorship prospectus. All sponsorships are tax-deductible through our 501(c)(3) fiscal sponsor.",
  ],
  [
    "Where will sponsor money go?",
    "Every dollar goes directly toward making Fire Hacks happen: venue rental, meals and snacks for all attendees, prizes, swag, workshop materials, and event logistics. We're a nonprofit — there's no profit motive here.",
